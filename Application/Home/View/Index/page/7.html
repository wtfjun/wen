</p>
<p>
    Shenzhen University (SZU) is the only comprehensive university in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SSEZ). It boasts of quite a number of disciplines conducive to the development of cultural industries. Years of efforts of the University have resulted in the distinctive features of top-notch scholarship and innovation in these industries. The Institute for Cultural Industries Shenzhen University (SICI) aims to integrate teaching, research and production with a distinctive pattern of “innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship”. As a result, a cluster of creative academic-industrial entities embodying the above-mentioned features and spirit came into being, namely, Art Tribe, Design Tribe, Media Tribe, Architecture Tribe, Performing Arts Tribe and Film Tribe.
</p>
<p>
    SICI incorporating these tribes was founded in May 2009. It is the first multi-disciplinary research institution of SZU. Backed by the various colleges of the University related with cultural industries, SICI has attracted more than 50 experts from the disciplines of art, design, media, advertising, architecture, film, animation, tourism, economics, management and law. These trained researchers with unique insight, foresight and broad vision are quick to act and to accomplish ambitious goals.
</p>
<p>
    The present dean of SICI is Professor Li Fengliang, vice president of SZU. The deputy deans areProfessor ZhouJianxin and Professor Zhou Zhimin. The Advisory Board and Academic Committee of SICI are composed of prestigious scholars and artists from both in and outside SZU, as well as well-known figures from other areas of China including officials in the cultural and publicity departments of governments at various levels.
